      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>The current project aims to "Design a system to enhance how people weave together within communities and wider society as a whole” (CHI 2019 SDC). In the following sections, I will describe all the stages we have been through these two first months in the Designing Innovation Class. We were divided in groups to propose and design solutions applying methods of Human Centered Design for looking, understanding and making.</p>

      <p>For this course assignment, we will employ human centered design (HCD) techniques both in-class and outside of class to identify target stakeholders and users and their needs. A team member from COURAGE specializing on this topic will be available to us.  This includes but is not limited to stakeholder mapping, interviewing, and competitive analysis of things they are currently using.</p>

      <p>Some concepts were refined along the project. A brief summary of this journey could be seen below, since my teammates started to identify the stakeholders until we came up with our solution called "Education Kitchen". This is when I came in, helping to prepare and refine the idea for the prototyping phase.</p>

      <h3>The main goals for this project are:</h3>

      <li>Offer an accessible and affordable solution</li>
      <li>Address some of the challenges such as cultural barriers and technology barriers often not addressed by other interventions (farmer food trucks, apps to teach about health literacy, etc.)</li>
      <li>Offer flexibility to address the local and regional differences across a state or a country (e.g. Florida vs. Wisconsin vs. Oregon)</li>
      <li>Design a solution that creates an energized global community of food literacy advocates and excitement about fresh produce (modified per feedback after initial prototype) as well as the importance of supporting local farmers and food gardens.</li>

          b. Bud: Yellow post-its, representing opportunities and potential ideas.<br>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>Requirement Definition
<ul><li>1 The solution shall address in a sustained manner the problem of poor eating habits and food choice decisions.</li>
<li>2	The solution will be a carefully curated collection of relevant and updated information about health and food literacy based on trusted sources.</li>
<li>3	The solution shall be easily implemented into teachers’ curriculum and</li> students from middle school. (11 to 13 years old)</li>
<li>4	The solution shall be easily implemented into students’ home life.</li>
<li>5	The solution shall work around complex policy level red tape by working directly with community stakeholders.</li>
<li>6	The solution shall be inclusive to address cultural and financial barriers to food security and “personalized” per region (U.S.) to address the diversity and differences in food availability, growing seasons, etc.</li>
<li>7	The solution shall include technology and non-technology features that engage teachers, students, families, farmers, and ideally the community as a whole.</li>
<li>8	The solution shall include non-technology features as activity books for students to take home, recipes, seed with a guide and fun facts about food. The non-technology aspect speaks to the fact that internet access and devices may not be available.</li>
<li>9	The non-technology feature (activity book) shall support lifelong learning and skills to promote good health.</li>
<li>10	The solution shall include a technology feature as an optional complementary item for the activity book; an enhanced learning “bonus”.</li>
<li>11	The technology feature shall be a native app that runs on both mobile and tablet devices. (iOS and Android)</li>
<li>12	The technology feature shall include an AR functionality to scan images of fruits and vegetables and show content as:Bigger Image of the fruit/vegetable, Fun facts about the fruit/vegetable, Nutritional information of the fruit/vegetable, Fruit/vegetable anatomy.</li>
<li>13	The technology feature (AR functionality) could work in tandem with a website designed to archive and share AR “postcards” globally, acting as a food journal.</li>
<li>14	The solution shall include different subscription price options for schools, parents, students and farmers.</li>
<li>15	The solution will be affordable to encourage stakeholders to invest and itemize as part of their overall budgets.</li>
<li>16	The solution’s overall brand and marketing shall be appealing to resonate with stakeholders.</li></ul>
