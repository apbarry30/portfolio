          met with Kim in the XR lab <br>
          first half is story telling light <br>
          what you missed <br>
          starts as a safe place then gets dark and when its gets dark the items can light up to show br what you missed <br>
          one narrative 2-3 minutes long . end is a call to action <br>

          start now and get audio. audio will drive the story. maybe you will have two scenes.
          can you go to the police? should you talk to a police officer?
