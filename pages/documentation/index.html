          1/31
          met with Kim in the XR lab
          first half is story telling light
          what you missed
          starts as a safe place then gets dark and when its gets dark the items can light up to show what you missed . one narrative 2-3 minutes long . end is a call to action

          start now and get audio. audio will drive the story. maybe you will have two scenes.
          can you go to the police? should you talk to a police officer?
