met with Kim in the XR lab
first half is story telling light
what you missed
starts as a safe place then gets dark and when its gets dark the items can light up to show what you missed . one narrative 2-3 minutes long . end is a call to action

start now and get audio. audio will drive the story. maybe you will have two scenes.
can you go to the police? should you talk to a police officer?
